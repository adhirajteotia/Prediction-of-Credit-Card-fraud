1. Feature Engineering: Explore additional features or transformations of existing features that could improve model performance.
Feature engineering plays a crucial role in capturing the underlying patterns in the data and improving the predictive power of the model.

2. Model Selection and Evaluation: Experiment with different machine learning algorithms and ensemble methods to identify the most effective model for predicting credit card fraud. 

3. Hyperparameter Tuning: Fine-tune the hyperparameters of the chosen classification model using techniques like grid search or random search.

4. Anomaly Detection Techniques: Explore anomaly detection techniques, such as isolation forests or autoencoders, which are specifically designed to detect outliers or anomalies in datasets. 
Anomaly detection methods may complement traditional classification approaches and provide additional insights into fraudulent transaction detection.

5. Collaboration and Knowledge Sharing: Foster collaboration with domain experts, data scientists, and stakeholders to leverage domain knowledge and insights for improving fraud detection capabilities.
