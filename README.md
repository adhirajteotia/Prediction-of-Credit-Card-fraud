# Credit Card Fraud Detection

## Overview

Credit cards are widely used for online purchases and payments due to their convenience. However, they also pose risks, such as credit card fraud, which involves the unauthorized use of someone else's credit card or credit card information for purchases or cash withdrawals. Credit card companies must detect fraudulent transactions promptly to prevent customers from being charged for unauthorized purchases.

This project aims to build a classification model to predict whether a credit card transaction is fraudulent or not. The dataset used contains transactions made by European cardholders in September 2013. It comprises transactions that occurred over two days, with 492 frauds out of 284,807 transactions. The dataset is highly unbalanced, with fraudulent transactions accounting for only 0.172% of all transactions.


## Approach

1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - Conduct comprehensive exploratory data analysis to understand the distribution of fraudulent and non-fraudulent transactions.
   - Visualize transaction features such as amount, time, and transaction type to identify patterns and anomalies.

2. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Handle missing or erroneous values in the dataset.
   - Address class imbalance using techniques such as oversampling, undersampling, or synthetic data generation.

3. **Feature Engineering**:
   - Extract relevant features from the dataset, including transaction amount, time of transaction, and frequency of transactions.
   - Normalize or scale features to enhance model performance.

4. **Model Selection and Training**:
   - Experiment with various classification algorithms suitable for imbalanced datasets, such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, or Support Vector Machines.
   - Utilize cross-validation and hyperparameter tuning to optimize model performance.
   - Evaluate models based on metrics like precision, recall, F1-score, and area under the ROC curve (AUC-ROC).

5. **Model Evaluation and Validation**:
   - Validate trained models using a separate test dataset or through cross-validation.
   - Assess model performance in terms of its ability to accurately classify fraudulent and non-fraudulent transactions while minimizing false positives and false negatives.

6. **Deployment and Monitoring**:
   - Deploy the trained model into production systems for real-time fraud detection.
   - Implement monitoring mechanisms to track model performance over time and update the model as needed to adapt to evolving fraud patterns.

## Conclusion

Building an effective fraud detection model for credit card transactions is essential for protecting customers and credit card companies from the financial implications of fraudulent activities. By leveraging advanced techniques and methodologies, we can develop a reliable model to detect and prevent fraudulent transactions, thereby enhancing the security of online transactions.
